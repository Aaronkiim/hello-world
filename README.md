# hello-world

Hey guys!
Aaron here... 
I'm from NJU. Now major in Physics yet doing research on NMT. Nice to meet you. 
Embarrassing self-introduction is like adding tags to oneself to cater to the atmosphere... I wish my github repositories will get larger and larger, which is a more honest place to deal my image and attract freinds sharing similar goals and ideas.
